# Dashboard

A simple Python project running inside Docker.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (>= 20.10)  
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  
- `make` (optional, if you want to use the provided `Makefile`)

## Available Commands

All commands below assume youâ€™re in the project root (`dashboard/`).

### Build the Docker image

Using **Makefile**:  
```sh
make build
```  
Or directly with Docker Compose:  
```sh
docker-compose build
```

### Run the container

Using **Makefile**:  
```sh
make run
```  
Or directly with Docker Compose:  
```sh
docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate
```

This will start the `safeflood` service and map port 8080 on your machine to port 8080 in the container.

### View logs

Using **Makefile**:  
```sh
make logs
```  
Or direct:  
```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Open a shell in the running container

Using **Makefile**:  
```sh
make shell
```  
Or direct:  
```sh
docker-compose exec safeflood /bin/bash
```

### Stop and remove containers

Using **Makefile**:  
```sh
make stop
```  
Or direct:  
```sh
docker-compose down
```

## Quick Test

Once the container is up, you can verify it by running:
```sh
docker-compose exec safeflood python hello.py
```
You should see:
```
Hello from safeflood!
```
